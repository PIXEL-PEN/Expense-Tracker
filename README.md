# Where It Went

**Track your spending — not your soul.**  
*A no-fluff, privacy-respecting expense tracker built for real life.*

<h2 style="font-size:1.6em; font-weight:700;">🧭 What Is This?</h2>

**Where It Went** is a simple, focused daily expense tracker designed for people who just want to know:  
> _“Where did all my money go?”_

No budgeting tools.  
No account syncing.  
No ads.  
No cloud.  
No sign-ups.  
No surveillance.

Just a clean interface that lets you log your expenses quickly, then shows you **where it went** — by day, month, or category.

<h2 style="font-size:1.6em; font-weight:700;">🌱 Why It Exists</h2>

Most expense trackers are either:

- Overly complicated (QuickBooks in disguise),
- Clunky or ugly,
- Infested with trackers and ads,
- Or make you link your bank just to log a sandwich.

**Where It Went** was born out of personal frustration with all of the above.  
It's made for people who value **clarity, simplicity, and privacy**.

It works *because* it doesn’t try to do everything — just one thing well.

<h2 style="font-size:1.6em; font-weight:700;">📌 Philosophy</h2>

> _“A system is only as good as the data you feed it.”_

**Where It Went** is built on this truth.  
It’s dead simple to use — but still relies on you to enter what you spend, accurately and consistently.

The reward?  
A clear snapshot of where your money went — no guesswork, no logins, no fluff.

Perfect for:
- Daily habit tracking (a few seconds per entry)
- Long-term project expenses (builds, hobbies, renovations)
- Trip budgeting and analysis (hotels, gas, food, the *“oops”* fund)

---

<h2 style="font-size:1.6em; font-weight:700;">🧱 Open Source</h2>

- 100% open source (license: MIT or your preferred license)  
- No hidden dependencies, no phone-home behavior  
- Built with minimalism and transparency in mind

<h2 style="font-size:1.6em; font-weight:700;">🙌 A Note from the Developer</h2>

This app was created out of personal need, not profit.  
It’s not trying to be everything — just something **useful, honest, and respectful**.

If it helps you, that’s all the reward I need.
