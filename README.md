## 🌱 Philosophy

ExpenseTracker is built to be:

- **Fast and simple** → record expenses in seconds, not minutes.  
- **Daily-friendly** → designed to be used every day without feeling heavy.  
- **Private & offline** → no accounts, no ads, no internet required.  
- **Respectful of your data** → everything is stored locally, with export options for backup.  

It’s not a fintech product — it’s a personal notebook for your money.

---

## ⚠️ Compatibility
- ✅ Works great on modern devices (Android 12+, API 31+).  
- ⚠️ On older 16:9 devices (e.g., Galaxy Note5, API 24):  
  - Top bars and banners may look oversized.  
  - This is cosmetic only — all functions still work.  
  - Scaling fixes are planned for future releases.  

---

## 🚀 Roadmap
- Better scaling on smaller/legacy screens.  
- Tagging system for categories (Fixed, Essential, Discretionary).  
- Export improvements (filters, date ranges).  
- Improved Settings layout with more options.  
- Additional visual polish and theming.
